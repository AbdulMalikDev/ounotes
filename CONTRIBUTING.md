## Code Style

OU Notes follows the famous **Stacked Architecture** [Click Here To Learn It](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdTodMosi-BwM4XkagNwe4KADOMWQS5X-). Please note that if your code is not formatted according to the guide as much as possible, we will reject your Pull Request until it is fixed. Some things such as long lines will generally be accepted, however try to make it smaller if possible.

## Efficiency

OU Notes is committed to efficiency as much as possible. If your code is not efficient, then we will probably reject your Pull Request.

## Rejections

Pull Request rejections are not a bad thing. It just means you need to fix something. Perhaps it is important to define 'rejection' as it is used in this case. A rejection is when a OU Notes committer comments on a Pull Request with a comment like 'rejected due to incorrect formatting'.
